We want to create API endpoints for the freetrader app that will be used by farmers, agricultural customers, domestic and international investors, government bodies, NGO bodies, and local logistics companies. Over time, as use cases for the app evolve, we will append the corresponding models, routes and controllers. Note that the code in this repo works on local machines, pending deployment.
